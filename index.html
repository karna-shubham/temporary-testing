        <h2>Task 1</h2>
        <p>for the which list implementaion, its def LinkedList, because here we are adding element at the beggining, and in linked list the time complexity to add at beginning is O(1), which is better than time complexity for adding element in ArrayList, which is O(n).</p>
        <p>for the time complexity, for the loop its gonna be O(n) ig and for the statement inside the loop i.e. to add the element its gonna be O(1), given its a LinkedList. Overall of the code? i dont know that, haven't studied time complexity in such depth as of now.</p>
    </div>

        <h2>Task2</h2>
        <p>Again I would choose LinkedList for this work. As removing the last element of linkeList cause time complexity of just O(1), while if we use ArrayList, using the remove functionality will cause O(n). Moreover if we use the pollLast() method we can be save from error as well, as it return null if list becomes empty. Though using a LIFO based Data structure makes more sense.</p>

        <h2>task 3</h2>
        <p>so the logic that is coming to my mind to solve this is that, we will make a temporary node, where we will copy the reference to the "first". then we will set the value of "first" to "last" and set the "last" to the temporary node that we had created earlier. I am not able to code this logic tho.</p>

        <h2>Task 4</h2>
        <pre><code>
            1. False: ArrayList is not ALWAYS faster than linkedList. like its iteration speed and get() function is faster but other methods like adding and removing is faster in LinkedList.
            2. False: For a LinkedList of size n and an ArrayList of size n, LinkedList uses more memory, as each element of LinkedList (node) contains 3 data: ref to prev, ref to next and the data itself.
            3. True.
        </code></pre>
